# RPJL (Rob's Professional Java Library)
RPJL, short for Rob's Professional Java Library, is a collection of Java classes and utilities built mainly for 
professional endeavors, but is also suitable for personal projects.

## Features (Problems & Solutions)
Each of the packages in this library serve a specific purpose, typically related to a specific problem.

### DatabaseUtils
**Problem:** The standard `ResultSet` class is forward-only meaning it can only be read once.  
**Solution:** Easier conversion between `ResultSet` and `CachedRowSet`, `ResultSet`'s non-forward-only cousin. 

### JSONParser & JSONTree
**Problem:** Parsing JSON data can be cumbersome and error-prone.
**Solution:** A representation of JSON data as a tree structure, allowing for easy manipulation and access to data.
